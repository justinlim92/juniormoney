# random_scripts

This repo contains random scripts/functions that I've come up with that helps me
in my day to day activities.

### aws_functions.sh
This script has a bunch of functions that I use day to day that help me find
the resources that I need in AWS.
Its contains/needs no user specific data to work.

Just place the script in your $PATH and you'll be able to call these functions
no matter where you are in your shell.
